		"The idea of life can have different meanings depending on the context and perspective. One way to approach it is to ask what is the definition of life, and another way is to ask what is the meaning or purpose of life.\n\nThe definition of life is a quality that distinguishes matter that has biological processes, such as signaling and self-sustaining processes, from matter that does not, and is defined by the capacity for growth, reaction to stimuli, metabolism, energy transformation, and reproduction[^7^] [^8^]. Life also comprises individuals, living beings, assignable to groups (taxa), each composed of one or more minimal living units, called cells, and capable of transformation of carbon-based and other compounds, growth, and participation in reproductive acts[^9^].\n\nThe meaning or purpose of life is a more philosophical question that may not have a definitive or universal answer. Different views on the meaning of life include fulfilling higher-order purposes, meriting substantial esteem or admiration, having a noteworthy impact, transcending one’s animal nature, making sense, or exhibiting a compelling life-story[^10^]. Some people may also believe that life is extremely personal, therefore each person's purpose will be different[^2^], or that life is created by a supernatural entity called God, that God had an intelligent purpose in creating us, and that this intelligent purpose is the meaning of life[^3^].",
